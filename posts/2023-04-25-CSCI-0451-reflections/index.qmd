This post is a running set of notes on my current course, CSCI 0451. 

## Possible Revised Sequencing

- Outline of the ML workflow and the sklearn API (2 lectures)
    - Working with data frames and numpy
- Features, overfitting, cross-validation (1-2 lectures)
- Theory + implementation (4 lectures)
    - Empirical risk
    - Gradient descent
    - Convexity? 
    - Logistic regression (no perceptron)
- Allocative bias
- Deep learning (largely unchanged, 6-8 lectures)
    - Representational harms

## Assignments

Many of the assignments can be left as is. I don't think they took a ton of value out of implementing perceptron; going straight into logistic regression as a first implementation problem would likely to be better. 

## Assessment

Having more direction for assignments completed might be helpful; students could benefit from some calibration on what counts as "enough." Might be worth even considering moving over to a version of specs grading: a specific number need to be completed to a specific degree of quality in order to be counted. 

## Speaker

Our engagement with TG had a few hiccups, but overall went quite well, especially regarding student engagement and morale. It would be nice to have this be a larger and recurring thing that happens, possibly once a semester, as part of the CS department standard offering. Could potentially be part of us reviving a seminar?
