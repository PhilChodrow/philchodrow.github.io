### Reach Me

The most reliable way is by email: pchodrow@middlebury.edu.

I am often in my office, Room 218 in 75 Shannon Street. Say hi whenever the door is open! 

I do not normally take calls to my office phone. 

### Meet with Me

To set up a meeting with me, please send me an email. I am likely to share with you a Calendly link that you can use to schedule a time.
