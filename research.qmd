My research addresses computational, mathematical, and statistical problems in the study of complex systems. My interests include network data science, dynamical models of social structures, and data science applications supporting equity and sustainability. 

## Methods of Network Data Science

How do we analyze and learn from network data? I build mathematical foundations for network data science algorithms, with recent focus on networks of higher-order interactions. Much of my work is devoted to developing novel random graph models and applying them in algorithms. Doing so often requires tools from probability, optimization, combinatorics, and random matrix theory.

## Models of Polarization, Hierarchy, and Inequality

Human and animal societies are structured by persistent hierarchies, inequalities, and divisions. Dynamical and statistical models can help us understand the extent of these structures, how they form, and under what conditions they persist. I am especially interested in the role of social feedback loops in reinforcing these structures.

## Data Science and Social Responsibility

I also use my skills and resources in the service of equity, sustainability, and justice. My efforts here includes both the development of novel methods for social data analysis and work on activist data science projects.  I pursue some of this work as a Partner at [QSIDE](https://qsideinstitute.org/), the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity.
