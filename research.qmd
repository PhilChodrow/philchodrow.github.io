My research addresses computational, mathematical, and statistical problems in the study of complex systems, especially social systems. My interests include  models of evolving networks; network data science; models with polyadic (higher-order) interactions; methods for quantifying segregation and polarization; and identity representation in academic science. I am especially interested in the interplay between mechanistic dynamical modeling and messy data sets. My research is currently supported by the National Science Foundation grant "RUI: Network Evolution with Unobserved Mechanisms." For my complete research record, see my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dgWoch0AAAAJ&hl=en).

I do [research with students](research-students.qmd), typically taking 1-2 students each summer and academic year. I've also written down some [thoughts](research-starter-pack.qmd) on what research students can expect from me and what I expect from them.
