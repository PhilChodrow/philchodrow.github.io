I'm Phil Chodrow, an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/cs) at [Middlebury College](https://www.middlebury.edu/#story645114) (as of July 1st, 2022). My pronouns are *he/him/his*. 

### Research

In [my research](research.qmd), I study mathematical and computational techniques for understanding our increasingly connected and complex world. A lot of what I do falls under the heading of *[network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science)*. Some of the things I've worked on recently include algorithms for analyzing hypergraph data using eigenvectors,models of opinion dynamics in social networks, and statistical models for studying hierarchy in human and animal societies. I also work on data science projects to promote equity and sustainability. 

### Teaching

In Fall 2022, I am teaching **CSCI 0145: Introduction to Computing**. 

I am a passionate educator, enthusiastic about evidence-based pedagogy, student-centered design, and inclusion in the classroom. Topics I teach include introductory computing, network science, and machine learning. Read more about my [mission](mission.qmd) and the [courses I teach](teaching.qmd).
