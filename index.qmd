### Welcome!  
      
I'm Dr. Phil Chodrow, an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/cs) at [Middlebury College](https://www.middlebury.edu/#story645114). My pronouns are *he/him/his*. 

### Research

[My research](research.qmd) focuses on [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science), the study of connected systems in society and nature. I draw on methods from applied mathematics, machine learning, statistics, and physics. I also work on data science projects to promote equity and sustainability. I have [awesome collaborators](research.qmd#key-collaborators). 

### Teaching

In Spring '24 I am teaching **[CSCI 0451: Machine Learning](https://middlebury-csci-0451.github.io/CSCI-0451-s24/)** and **[CSCI 0702: Senior Thesis](https://www.philchodrow.prof/csci-702-ws24/)**. 


   
I am on a [mission](mission.qmd). I teach [other courses](teaching.qmd). Middlebury students might want to take a look at my [FAQs](midd-student-faqs.qmd).
