### Welcome! 
      
I'm Dr. Phil Chodrow, an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.middlebury.edu/academics/cs) at [Middlebury College](https://www.middlebury.edu/#story645114). My pronouns are *he/him/his*. 

### Research

[My research](research.qmd) focuses on [network science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science), the study of connected systems in society and nature. I draw on methods from applied mathematics, machine learning, statistics, and physics. I also work on data science projects to promote equity and sustainability. I have [awesome collaborators](research.qmd#key-collaborators). 

### Teaching

In Fall 2023, I am teaching **[CSCI 0200: Math Foundations of Computing](https://www.philchodrow.prof/CSCI-0200)**. My office hours are: 

**Mondays**, 2pm-4pm <br> 
**Thursdays**, 3pm-4pm




I am on a [mission](mission.qmd). I teach [other courses](teaching.qmd). Students might want to take a look at my [FAQs](for-students.qmd).
