    "text": "Recap\nLast time, we studied the information-theoretic idea of entropy and its relationship to our intuitive concept of diversity. We saw that the entropy \\(H\\) is highest precisely when all possible groups are represented equally in a population, and lowest when only one group is represented. High entropy, high diversity.\nNow let’s move on to an information-theoretic view of segregation. It’s important to remember that segregation is a fundamentally distinct concept from diversity. We can remind ourselves of this difference by recalling the example of the tea drinkers in the cafe. There are drinkers who prefer black, red, and green teas; on three different days, the population of the cafe looked like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTea drinkers in the cafe on three different days. Colors encode the kinds of tea they are drinking.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re interested in whether or not the shop is diverse, and whether or not it is segregated (by room). Intuitively,\n\nFriday is neither diverse nor segregated.\nSaturday is diverse, but relatively unsegregated.\nSunday is diverse but highly segregated.\n\nAs you may remember, the entropy \\(H\\) could distinguish Friday (\\(H = 0\\)) from Saturday and Sunday (\\(H = 1.10\\)), but couldn’t distinguish Saturday and Sunday from each other. For that we need more subtle ideas. Let’s dive in!"

    "text": "Mutual Information Measures Dependence\nReaders with statistical background might read the above as a statement about dependence: \\(I(X,Y)\\) measures the degree of statistical association between room and tea preference. Let’s step back from the context of diversity for a moment to explore this point. To do this, let’s compare \\(I(X,Y)\\) to a more familiar quantity that does something similar: the correlation coefficient \\(R^2\\). If you took a statistics class, you might remember linear regression, the problem of drawing a “best fit” line through a cloud of data plotted on the \\(x-y\\) plane. One thing you might have done was to compute “\\(R^2\\),” which is more formally called the Pearson correlation coefficient. When \\(R^2 = 1\\), the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is perfectly correlated with the explanandum \\(y\\), but when \\(R^2 = 0\\), there’s no linear relationship. One thing that might have been emphasized to you is:\n\n\\(R^2 = 0\\) does not imply that the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent.\n\nHere’s a set of examples that you can view on Wikipedia: the bottom row data sets are all uncorrelated (\\(R^2 = 0\\)), but clearly not independent.\nThe mutual information \\(I(X,Y)\\) is something like a supercharged correlation coefficient, in the sense that:\n\n\\(I(X,Y) = 0\\) does imply that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.\n\nOne nice thing about this result is that it actually makes precise an intuition about probabilistic dependence that many of us share: two variables are dependent if knowing one “gives you information” about the other. \\(I(X,Y)\\) quantifies this idea and makes it rigorously correct. Another way to say this is:\n\nThe tea shop is segregated when knowing which room someone is sitting in gives high information about their tea preferences, or vice versa."

    "text": "Dividing Walls\nIn fact, we can do even more complex decompositions. Let \\(f:X \\mapsto Z\\) be a function. We think of \\(f\\) as an aggregation or labeling. This is an extremely practical propety of information measures when performing multiscale spatial analysis. Here’s a figure from my paper on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nCensus tracts in Detroit. Each tract is colored according to the racial group that is most overrepresented there when compared to the overall city-wide average. Black lines were found by an algorithm, and their thickness corresponds to their contribution to overall segregation. I have since learned that the use of a catchall category “Other” is harmful, and will work on doing better on this in the future. Figure reproduced from Chodrow, P. (2017). Structure and Information in Spatial Segregation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure divides the city of Detroit, MI into six regions. If \\(X\\) is a census tract, we can think of \\(f:X\\mapsto X\\) as the function that assigns to each \\(X\\) the region in which that tract is located. Now, mathematically, a quick argument shows that we can write\n\\[\nI(X,Y) = I(Z,Y) + I(X,Y|Z)\\;,\n\\]\nwhere \\(I(X,Y|Z)\\) is the mean mutual information within each of the regions. We can again interpret these terms: \\(I(Z,Y)\\) is the amount of segregation accounted for by the division into regions, while \\(I(X,Y|Z)\\) is the amount of segregation “left over” because it lies within regions. Substituting back into Equation 1, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(Y) &= H(Y|X) + I(Z,Y) + I(X,Y|Z) \\\\\n\\text{Global Diversity} &= \\text{Local Exposure} + \\text{Segregation Between Regions} + \\text{Segregation Within Regions}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis style of analysis is extremely helpful for studying segregation at multiple scales."

    "section": "Information As Approximation",
    "text": "Information As Approximation\nLet \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) be two finite sets. Let \\(p_{XY}\\) be a probability distribution on \\(\\mathcal{X}\\times \\mathcal{Y}\\). That is, if I pick a random object from \\(\\mathcal{X}\\times \\mathcal{Y}\\), the probability that this object has property \\(x \\in \\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\) is \\(p_{XY}(x,y)\\). Concretely, think of \\(X\\) as being a demographic feature like wealth and \\(Y\\) as being a spatial location. Then, \\(p_{XY}(\\text{high wealth}, \\mathrm{Providence})\\) is the fraction of all people who have high wealth and live in Providence. We’ll develop an information measure to quantify the extent to which \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are dependent or correlated. I’ll treat the extent of dependence or correlation as an operating definition of “demographic spatial segregation.”\nWe develop the idea of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as being dependent by considering the conditional distributions \\(p_{X|y}(x) = \\frac{p_{XY}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}\\).  Here, \\(p_Y(y) = \\sum_{x\\in \\mathcal{X}} p_{XY}(x,y)\\) is the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\). You can think of \\(p_{X|y}(x)\\) as the probability that an individual in location \\(y\\) has demographic attribute \\(x\\). The distribution \\(p_{X|y}\\) is an element of \\(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathcal{X}}\\), the set of probability distributions over \\(\\mathcal{X}\\). We have one of those distributions for each possible choice of \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\). If these distributions are very different – if they depend strongly on the choice of \\(y\\) – then knowing \\(y\\) would make a big difference in what we know about \\(x\\). We would say that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are highly dependent. How do we measure how different the collection of distributions \\(\\{p_{X|y}\\}\\) is? A standard, two-step approach is:The notation \\(p_{X|y}(x)\\) is nonstandard, and is chosen to make some later calculations a bit more compact.\n\nFirst, find a point \\(\\bar{p}_X\\) that best approximates all the marginal distributions \\(p_{X|y}\\).\nCompute the average divergence of the conditionals to \\(\\bar{p}_X\\). This average is\n\n\\[\nI_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) d_f(p_{X|y}, \\bar{p}_X)\n\\]\nThis is a gnarly expression, but you can think of as expressing: on average, how far (in the sense of divergence \\(d_f\\)) is a typical local distribution \\(p_{X|y}\\) from its approximator \\(\\bar{p}_X\\)? If the answer is small, then we know that all the local distributions aren’t too far from their approximators, and therefore shouldn’t be too far from each other, either.\nAs it turns out, there’s a correct choice of \\(\\bar{p}_X\\). This result is Proposition 1 of Banerjee et al. (2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2 (Mean is a Minimizer) For any Bregman divergence, the smallest value of \\(I_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X)\\) is attained when \\(\\bar{p}_X = p_X\\), the marginal distribution of \\(X\\). This distribution is given by \\(p_X(x) = \\sum_{y \\in Y}p_{XY}(x,y)\\). More formally,\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin\\;}}_{\\bar{p}_X} I_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X) = p_X\\;.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBregman Information\n\n\n\nWe will use the abbreviation \\(I_f(X: Y) = I_f(X:Y;p_X)\\) for the minimizing value of \\(I_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X)\\). We call \\(I_f(X:Y)\\) the Bregman information in \\(Y\\) about \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 3 (Bregman Information and Independence) \nLet \\(f\\) be strictly convex and let \\(p_Y(y) > 0\\) for all \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\). Then, \\(I_f(X:Y) = 0\\) if and only if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nProof. Recall that \\(I_f(X:Y) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) d_f(p_{X|y}, p_X)\\). Since \\(p_Y(y) > 0\\) for each \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\) by hypothesis, for \\(I_f(X:Y) = 0\\) we must have \\(d_f(p_{X|y}, p_X)\\) for each \\(y\\). If \\(f\\) is strictly convex, then by Theorem 1, \\(d_f(p,q) = 0\\) iff \\(p = q\\). So, we must have \\(p_{X|y} = p_X\\) for each \\(y\\), which implies that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.\n\nThere is another formula for the Bregman information that helps to interpret its meaning. This formula is the version emphasized in this post, which expresses global diversity as a sum of local diversity and global segregation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 4 The Bregman information satisfies\n\\[\nI_f(X:Y) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) f(p_{X|y}) - f(p_X)\\;.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nProof. We can directly write out\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    I_f(X:Y) &= \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) d_f(p_{X|y}, p_X) \\\\\n             &= \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) \\left[f(p_{X|y}) - f(p_X) - \\langle \\nabla f(p_X), p_{X|y} - p_X\\rangle \\right] \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nNext, we use that \\(\\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) p_X = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) p_{X|y} = p_X\\), which causes the inner product to vanish. The only remaining terms are\n\\[\nI_f(X:Y) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) f(p_{X|y}) - f(p_X)\\;,\n\\]\ncompleting the proof.\n\nTheorem 4 is often used as the definition of the mutual information in the context of Shannon information theory; indeed, it’s the definition that I emphasize in my previous post on Shannon information theory. The interpretation of this theorem as relating global segregation, global diversity, and local diversity translates directly."

This map is draggable, zoomable, and clickable.\nThere are some issues here with the polygons not being totally correctly aligned. I believe that this is an issue with map projection that can be easily solved, but I haven’t looked into it further."

    "text": "Why Information Theory?\nInformation theory is the mathematical theory of what is learnable and communicable. It might not be obvious that information theory is a promising framework for thinking about diversity and segregation. The study of segregation isn’t usually viewed as an inference or communication engineering problem, and therefore doesn’t get much attention from information theorists and statisticians. On the other hand, sociological researchers in quantitative segregation studies do use information-theoretic measures, but tend to be less concerned about the mathematical subtleties. My goal in this blog post and the next is to develop information theory from the ground up as an organizing framework for thinking about diversity segregation. This framework both makes explicit the logic of some of our intuitive thinking about segregation, and also points the way to a wide vista of important extensions, generalizations, and applications."

We’ll ultimately develop a rather beautiful equation that organizes a few key concepts in segregation studies:\n\n\\[\\text{Global Diversity} = \\text{Local Exposure} + \\text{Global Segregation}\\]\nIn order to cash out each of these terms in math, we are going to study the entropy, conditional entropy, and mutual information.\nWhat mathematical background do you need? I won’t be assuming any prior knowledge of information theory, although it certainly doesn’t hurt.[^1] You’ll need elementary probability theory – concepts like conditional probabilities and expectation values will be enough.\nAll that said, let’s talk about entropy! First we’ll set up a little toy scenario to analyze."

Schematically, it looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favorite cafe back home.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say the cafe serves just three beverages, all of them different kinds of tea: black, red, and green.  This being a popular establishment, on any given day, the rooms are full of folks drinking tea. On three different days last week, the shop looked like this:With apologies to all white and oolong drinkers. Chamomile, tough.\n\n\n\n\n\nTea drinkers in the cafe on three different days. Colors encode the kinds of tea they are drinking.\n\n\n\n\nEach little square represents a person; there are \\(6\\times 6 = 36\\) customers in the shop on both days. On Friday, we had an overwhelming wave of green tea fanatics, who left no room for drinkers of any other preferences in the shop. On Saturday, each of the three tea preferences was equally represented, and folks spread themselves throughout the shop more-or-less randomly. On Sunday, the three main tea preferences were again evenly represented, but they were cliquey–folks tended to sit in the same room as people who shared their tea preferences."

    "section": "My Profession",
    "text": "My Profession\n\nWhat are you? Are you a computer scientist, a mathematician, or a data scientist?\nUh…yes? I am all those things!\nMy training was primarily mathematical. These days I use math, algorithms, simulations, and data analysis to learn about complex systems in theory, society, and nature. Almost all my work involves software implementation, and I’m working on growing my skills as a developer in order to help more people use and reproduce my findings.\n\n\nWhat kinds of things do you like to study?\nNetworks and complex social systems! You can learn lots more about my interests on my research page.\n\n\nWhat do you do all day?\nThis graphic by Marissa Kawehi Loving gives a high-level overview of the activities that go into a career as an academic mathematician. My activities as a computer scientist / mathematician / data scientist look relatively similar. Mentally, I’d divide them into the following broad categories:\n\n“Doing science”: developing models and algorithms, proving mathematical facts about them, performing computations, analyzing data, and reading papers.\nWriting: creating notes, writing scholarly papers, writing reviews of the scholarly work of others.\nCommunication: largely emails and meetings. Lots of the “doing science” part happens in these meetings (i.e. collaboratively). An important category here is mentorship: working with junior collaborators and students; talking about ideas; giving feedback. Another important category here is speaking about my research, which used to happen at conferences but is now largely online.\nTeaching: I spend a lot of time on teaching. The preparation includes formulating course philosophies, designing curricula, writing lectures and assignments, etc. Then there’s the best part – working with students – as well as managing instructional teams, handling grades, and troubleshooting concerns as they arise.\n\nProfessional development: there’s a lot of room for me to grow. One of my main goals is to further develop my courses as actively anti-sexist and anti-racist, and measure their effectiveness along these axes. I attend trainings, read, and learn from others.\n\n\n\nIs it nice to be a professor? Should I become one?\nHere’s my personal list of the pros and cons about being a professor. This list is quite personal to me, and reflects my identity and priorities. Note that the pros and cons for computer scientists and mathematicians working in industry look very different.\nPros:\n\nFreedom to control my own schedule.\nFreedom to set my priorities and spend much of my time thinking about things that interest me.\nFreedom to decide whom to work with (very important to me).\n\nCons:\n\nLow salary compared to many other careers for quantitative people (although still enough for me to have a comfortable life).\nUncertainty about long-term job prospects. I didn’t know where I would spend most of my career—or whether I would even make it in my chosen career—until I was 31.\nLack of control over location: I’m very happy here, and I’m exceptionally lucky to have been able to choose to come here over several other attractive options. In general, though, academics often won’t be able to choose where they will live. This is one factor that can contribute to challenges associated with being an academic and starting a family.\n\n\n\nIs academic science an equitable space, a “meritocracy,” or a “neutral” discipline?\nNo. Academic science is not yet an equitable community, and many parts of it replicate systemic misogyny, racism, ableism, and classism. Certain people, departments, and institutions are not safe or nurturing spaces for members of certain groups. For example, a recent article in Scientific American highlighted the intersection of racism and misogyny in modern mathematics.\nDue in part to my own privileged identity, I have had an overall pleasant experience in academic science which makes me want to stay here. If you do aspire to become an academic computer scientist, mathematician, data scientist, or scholar of any kind—and especially if you benefit from intersecting privilege—then part of your responsibility is to reflect on what work you will do to make our profession a more equitable and just place. The Mission page expresses how I think about this responsibility, and the Resources page contains some links that might help you get started."

As argued in a recent study, many of us have harmful, gendered biases about when we use earned titles like “Dr.” or “Professor.” A small, simple thing you can do to make academia a more equitable place is to check your own potential biases. If you’re not sure, “Professor X” or “Dr. X” is always a safe choice — but even better is to just ask what your instructor prefers! My own personal preference is related to this short poem by Susan Harlan."

    "text": "Research with Students\n\nWould you be a good fit for my research interests?\nI love working with students on research projects! We might be a good fit for each other if several (but not necessarily all) of the statements below describe you.\n\nYou are interested in networks, models of social behavior, or other topics mentioned on my research page.\n\nYou have strong computing skills (for example, you’ve taken a 300-level computer science course).\n\nYou have strong math background (for example, you’ve taken some mathematics or statistics courses at the 200- and 300-levels).\nYou’ve taken a course that studies graphs and their applications, like CSCI 200 or MATH 247.\n\nYou are excited about applying computational and mathematical techniques to real-world data sets.\nYou want to use your computational skills to contribute to social justice, equity, or sustainability.\nYou already have a scientific problem or data set on which you want mentorship related to data science, modeling, or computation.\nYou want to contribute to to open science by developing and sharing reproducible code.\n\nAdditionally, I prefer to work with students as long-term collaborators. This means that I’m more likely to accept you as a summer research student if you also intend to continue working with me during the school year. The most common ways to do this are by enrolling in either CSCI 500 (Advanced Study) or CSCI 702 (Senior Thesis).\n\n\nAm I likely to get a research position in your group?\nFirst, I’m sure you’re awesome! If several of the points above describe you, then I expect we could work successfully together. Second, there are many students with research interest. Due to limitations on my time and funding resources, I sadly don’t expect to be able to accept all of them."

    "section": "Advice and Recommendation Letters",
    "text": "Advice and Recommendation Letters\n\nCan I talk to you about future courses/grad school/jobs/internships?\nDefinitely! Shoot me an email and we’ll set up a meeting. Just to set expectations, I know a lot more about courses and academic careers than I do about jobs and internships.\n\n\nWill you write me a letter of recommendation?\nYou may need a letter of recommendation from a faculty member for applications to graduate school, jobs, or internships.\nIf you have completed a course with me or are currently enrolled, you are welcome to request a letter from me. I will only refuse if you are requesting support for an application for jobs or internships involving surveillance, policing, or military applications. If I feel that I am not able to write you a strong letter, I will tell you – but if you still want a letter from me, I will still write it.\nPlease keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or office hours. If you’d like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.\nTo request a letter, fill out this request form! Please give me at least one month of advance notice when possible.\n\nWhen I Won’t Write a Letter\nAs a matter of moral principle, I will not write letters of recommendation for programs or jobs involving any of the following:\n\nPolicing (including but not limited to predictive policing, development of algorithms that predict recidivism, etc.);\nMilitary applications (such as internships at the Department of Defense or any of its international counterparts);\nWeapons manufacturing, broadly construed;\nIntelligence gathering (such as internships at the NSA, FBI, or any international counterpart).\n\nI am very happy to discuss this policy with any student who has questions. Conversations about when and how mathematics, data science, and programming should be used are lacking in our community. If you’d like to engage me in such a conversation, that would be great! However, this policy is non-negotiable. Therefore, if I refuse to write you a letter on these grounds, please know that it doesn’t reflect on your ability to succeed in this course, your career potential, your worth as a person, or whether I like you.\nThe Just Mathematics Collective has compiled a list of resources for students on making ethical career decisions, which is available here. The text of this section is lightly modified from their suggested text on letter-writing.\n\n\n\nI want to learn more about the intersection of computing, math, data science, and social justice.

    "title": "FAQs",
    "section": "Thoughts on Software",
    "text": "Thoughts on Software\n\nWhat software do you use?\nI spend a lot of time on my laptop, and I’ve given some thought to the tools that allow me to be most productive in that time. Here’s what I’m using these days:\n\nProgramming languages: Julia and R. I also know (and teach) Python, but Julia has largely replaced Python in my research workflows. I use R when I am primarily working with data frames or when I need to construct scientific graphics, and I use Julia for most other tasks. I still occasionally work in Python when collaborating with folks who strongly prefer it.\nWriting: LaTeX and Markdown. I use LaTeX for most technical writing, including scientific articles, reviews of other’s writings, working notes containing proofs and similar things, and any time I want to produce a PDF document. Lots of folks don’t like LaTeX, but perhaps through raw familiarity I am a very cheerful LaTeX writer. I use Markdown for most other writing, especially including writing for websites like this one.\nText editor: VSCode. I use this for writing code, as well as writing mathematical documents and research papers using LaTeX. I have extensions that make it easy to work with some of my main tools, including Python, Julia, R, LaTeX, Quarto, and Markdown. When coding in R, I sometimes use RStudio instead of VSCode.\nOperating system: MacOS. I don’t have strong negative feelings about Windows, but as someone who writes code I strongly prefer an OS with a first class terminal. I have dabbled in Linux but don’t consider myself enough of a power user to justify the time investment. Because I have access to high-performance servers, I don’t need a very powerful laptop – I just use an entry-level MacBook Air.\nWebsite: Quarto and GitHub. This website, as well as my course websites, are generated by the Quarto publishing sytem using plaintext files. I edit these files in VSCode, run Quarto to preview them, and then push them to GitHub which hosts them online. Through working on my websites, I have picked up a minimal amount of HTML and CSS.\n\nEthics note: GitHub has contributed an infrastructure product to ICE and developed a machine learning product that may infringe on open source code licenses. While I rely on GitHub for now, I may change to a competitor like GitLab or BitBucket in the future.\n\nEmail client: Spark – it’s free, simple, and cross-platform.\nLauncher: Alfred. Pressing a simple keyboard shortcut spawns a search bar when I can open apps, search for files, etc.\nBrowser: Vivaldi. A customizable browser compatible with Chrome plugins.\n\n\n\nIs programming language A better than programming language B?\nProbably not! Most programming languages have certain strengths in which they excel. You don’t need “the best” programming language – you need the one that’s right for your task. For example, R and Python have different strengths for data science, and most practicing data scientists know both. Here are my thoughts on the languages I know and use.\n\nPython: extremely versatile, pretty good at almost everything. Often slower than compiled languages like C++ or just-in-time compiled languages like Julia. Widely used in industry, and an excellent first language to learn. Extremely vibrant ecosystem of free software modules.\nR: specialized for data analysis and statistics. World-class handling of tabular data via the Tidyverse ecosystem. ggplot2 is the world’s best two-dimensional data visualization system, bar none. The RStudio IDE is excellent.\n\nJulia: specialized for technical computing (science and engineering applications). Similar syntax to Python. Often compared to Matlab in its focus, but open-source and (in my view) easier to understand. Well-written Julia is extremely fast, and can reach speeds comparable to C++."

I am aware that my work as an aspiring ally is never done, and that I will need to perpetually reexamine my own positionality and my understanding of my other commitments towards justice.\n\n\nMany students face unjust adversity in their STEM learning journey.\nMany female, LGBTQ+, BIPOC and disabled students encounter discouragement, trauma, and institutional barriers on account of their identities. These forms of adversity manifest systemic misogyny, homophobia, racism, and ableism.\nI envision a world in which all identities experience encouragement, safety, and grace in their pursuit of STEM education. I design inclusive classrooms with vibrant learning communities, clear expectations, and intentional assessment strategies. I conduct regular evaluations and listen to my students in order to understand how to make my teaching more responsive to the needs of all the learners who enter my classroom.\n\n\nNot all “scientific progress” serves humanity.\nMany scientists create tools for surveillance, control, advertising, physical violence, financial manipulation, and misinformation spread.\nWhile the choices of individuals to pursue such work is understandable in our current system of incentives, the net result is that much of our collective technical expertise actively works against our collective well-being. I work towards an ethical practice of computational science by actively incorporating ethics into my classrooms.

I love the SLAC environment, and think it’s a great place for many academics. Since SLAC jobs are less visible in PhD-granting institutions than research-intensive jobs, many folks may not know much about what these jobs are like or how to get them. Careers at SLACs offer distinctive advantages and disadvantages when compared to careers at research-intensive institutions. The purpose of this page is to give some basic information about my CS position at Middlebury (which I believe is not unrepresentative of many CS SLAC positions), and to share some tips from my recent experience as both an applicant and a hiring committee member."

    "text": "My Position\nI started as a tenure-track assistant professor at Middlebury in fall of 2022, so I’m still learning the ropes. Here are the rough contours of my position:\n\nMy teaching portfolio includes introductory CS and machine learning. I am likely to add teaching in math foundations (discrete math) and network science in the near term.\nMy teaching load is five 12-week courses per year. Usually at least two of these courses are simultaneous sections of the same offering, so I am only ever preparing for two distinct classes at once.\nMy service expectations involve contributing to the mission of the department and potentially serving on one committee that serves the broader College. I am largely exempt from service expectations in my first year. I have chosen voluntarily to take up a small role in building our department’s Responsible Computing program.\nMy salary is relatively low among CS positions at top liberal arts schools, but there was enough to draw me here regardless.\nI am currently funded by roughly $50K of startup. My startup package is primarily related to advanced computing needs and additional research travel. I worked out this package with our Dean of Faculty during contract negotiations.\nAfter my startup expires, I will have regular access to $4K/year of ongoing research funds. I can apply for grants if I need more funding.\nI have not yet taken research students, but Middlebury will usually fund 2-3 summer students. I can also take research students for academic credit during the school year.\nI will have a full-year sabbatical in my fifth year, and then every six years thereafter.\nI will be reviewed in my third year and again (for tenure and promotion) in my seventh year. For tenure, I am expected to demonstrate excellence in teaching and a reputation for significant research in the broader scientific community. There have been no unsuccessful tenure cases in my department.\nSome perks include very comfortable, subsidized faculty housing; discounts at the College-owned ski areas; and some very nice built-in support networks through the College."

    "section": "Application Tips",
    "text": "Application Tips\n\nBefore You Enter the Job Market\nConsider how you are going to demonstrate both excellence as a researcher and promise as an instructor. Hiring committees understand that not all candidates will have had opportunities to serve as instructors of record at the time they apply. You should, however, give us evidence that you will grow into an outstanding instructor. Some good kinds of evidence include:\n\nStudent evaluations of teaching (SET) ratings and selected comments.\nMaterials that you created as an instructor or teaching assistant.\nParticipation in professional development activities related to teaching.\n\nIt’s usually expected that at least one of your letters of recommendation will speak to your teaching potential. With this in mind, you should plan early: who will write your teaching letter, and what information will they have? It’s a good idea to ask your prospective writer well in advance. Their letter may be stronger if you can give them materials from previous courses, a draft of your teaching statement, or an opportunity to observe one of your classes.\n\n\nIn Your Cover Letter\nFirst and foremost, carefully read the job ad in order to avoid silly mistakes. If your cover letter highlights your interest in mentoring graduate students, and the institution doesn’t have graduate students, then the committee is unlikely to move forward on your application.\nMore generally, find ways to connect the job posting to your interests, and share them in your cover letter. My cover letter to Middlebury expressed:\n\nMy overall interest in the school and the department.\nMy excitement about the location, including the presence of many collaborators at nearby institutions.\nMy interest in collaborating on data science initiatives, which I knew from the job ad and the Middlebury website to be an area of institutional focus.\nMy teaching interests and how I felt these would align with the department’s mission."

I feel like I’ve grown in my abilities to describe my ideas, communicate my coding thought process, work as a member of a group, time manage, not procrastinate, and approach problems with confidence instead of doubt. Thank you Professor Chodrow, and to all the TAs and LAs who have put so much time and love into this course! I’ve learned so much and I’m so excited to use it!!!  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nMy confidence has skyrocketed since taking this class. Coming from a low income community I felt extremely behind in the STEM field when I entered UCLA, and thought that any career with coding would just be a pipedream. Once I finished…my project it made me realize that I could actually do these things, and if I work hard and continue with my coding I could do it for a living.  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nI can’t believe I learned so much in the span of 10 weeks!! When I was interviewing for internships I could quote some of the class assignments and people were impressed :)  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nThank you for igniting the fire in me to pursue programming. Honestly, I entered this class scared because of the lack of coding experience. But in these three months, I ended up loving programming…I feel blessed that I got the opportunity to be in your class  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\n…going into this class, I was extremely worried and asking myself why I’m even trying. Thankfully, basically thanks to your doing, I’m leaving this course with a sense of pride about how much I’ve achieved and learned despite the voice in the back of my mind telling me I can’t do it…I’m proud of the progress I’ve made…  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\nI learned so much from this quarter. I feel the blogs were very helpful for me to understand the lectures and Dr. Chodrow always answers questions in a very clear way. He also makes the class super welcoming. The project is difficult but I’m really surprised that we were able to accomplish what we have. It’s a unique experience.  - PIC16B, Spring ’21\nThis class was fast-paced, but not unmangeable–it did challenge me, but in a good way.  - PIC16B, Fall ’21"

Now, I have refueled hope and excitement to learn and explore topics from this course in the future.  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nHe is so understanding and the first professor to actually get to know my name, and he did this within the span of a few weeks. He is funny, understanding, nice and genuinely resonates with his students….I would have to say he is the best professor I’ve ever had.  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\nI just want to say that both the TA and professor did an amazing job with approaching the students and making them feel comfortable in our learning environment. It made a difficult and complex class a lot less stressful.  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nHis instruction and the way he has set up the class clearly demonstrates his dedication to teaching.

I am so grateful for these friendships I have made.  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nThe best thing about PIC 16A with regards to the class is my group! Discussion sections are one of the highlights of my week! We also have scheduled a time every week where we work together on the homework. It’s so refreshing to have contact with new people in these crazy circumstances.  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\nI think I’ve grown to see how valuable collaborative work is. Everyone has a unique way of working through logical problems and when these different thought processes come together, it’s like they merge into one new mega thought process >:)  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nDiscussion activities were challenging but great; my group members and I, who aren’t very vocal, often physically cheered when something ran successfully.  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nI have definitely improved in my ability to work collaboratively during the duration of this quarter. In discussion, I learned to speak up and provide my opinions on certain problems we were doing even when I thought I was the least qualified person in my group to provide an input. I also learned how to truly listen to their inputs on how and why to solve a certain problem.  - PIC16A, Fall ’21\nI think creating blog posts to do the homework assignments was wonderful! I’ve learned so much in this course not only through Professor Chodrow but also through my peers. Professor Chodrow facilitated a collaborative environment through peer feedbacks, which I loved.  - PIC16B, Spring ’21\nThe group project was a great way for me to make new friends and work with other students.  - PIC16B, Fall ’21"

ICON is curated by the group of Aaron Clauset at CU Boulder.\nThe Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP) hosts a wide range of network data sets. SNAP is curated by Jure Leskovec and Andrej Krevl at Stanford University.\nAustin Benson at Cornell hosts a collection of data sets for a range of problems related to graphs and hypergraphs.\nThe Data Science For Good Lab, led by Michael Fire at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, hosts a number of very interesting data sets. Many of these have network structure.\nUCLA students Christine Gu, Yu-Hsin Huang, and Shaodian Wang assembled a data set of Reddit submissions and comments related to the COVID-19 vaccine. You are welcome to access the data and use it in projects. Please acknowledge Christine, Yu-Hsin, and Shaodian in any published work that uses this data.\n\nCongress In Data collects a wide range of data sets, including many with network structure, on the US Senate and House of Representatives."
