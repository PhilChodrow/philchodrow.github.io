I love the SLAC environment and think it’s a great place for many academics. Careers at SLACs offer distinctive advantages and disadvantages when compared to careers at research-intensive institutions. Since SLAC jobs are less visible in PhD-granting institutions than research-intensive jobs, many folks may not know much about what these jobs are like or how to get them. The purpose of this page is to give some basic information about my CS position at Middlebury (which I believe is not atypical of many CS SLAC positions), and to share some tips from my recent experience as both an applicant and a hiring committee member."

    "text": "My Position\nI started as a tenure-track assistant professor at Middlebury in fall of 2022. Here are the rough contours of my position:\n\nMy teaching portfolio includes introductory CS, machine learning, math foundations of computing (discrete math) and thesis supervision. I will be developing a course on network science in the near future.\nMy teaching load is four 12-week courses per year. Usually these courses are doubled sections of the same course in at least one semester.\nMy service expectations involve contributing to the mission of the department and potentially serving on one committee that serves the broader College. I was exempt from service expectations in my first year, but chose to take up a small role in building our department’s Responsible Computing program. I am currently on the steering committee of midd.data, Middlebury’s initiative around data science and data literacy.\nMy salary is relatively low among CS positions at top liberal arts schools, but there was enough to draw me here regardless.\nI am currently funded by roughly $50K of startup. My startup package is primarily related to advanced computing needs and additional research travel. I worked out this package with our Dean of Faculty during contract negotiations.\nAfter my startup expires, I will have regular access to $4K/year of ongoing research funds. I can apply for grants if I need more funding.\nI have not yet taken research students, but Middlebury will usually fund 2-3 summer students. I can also take research students for academic credit during the school year.\nI will have a full-year sabbatical in my fifth year, and then every sixth year thereafter.\nI will be reviewed in my third year and again (for tenure and promotion) in my seventh year. For tenure, I am expected to demonstrate excellence in teaching and a reputation for significant research in the broader scientific community. There have been no unsuccessful tenure cases in my department.\nSome perks include very comfortable, subsidized faculty housing; discounts at the College-owned ski areas; and some very nice built-in support networks through the College.\n\nAlthough my primary experience is in CS departments, I suspect that the following tips will also be useful for folks in math and statistics as well."

    "section": "Application Tips",
    "text": "Application Tips\n\nBefore You Enter the Job Market\nConsider how you are going to demonstrate both excellence as a researcher and promise as an instructor. Hiring committees understand that not all candidates will have had opportunities to serve as instructors of record at the time they apply. You should, however, give us evidence that you will grow into an outstanding instructor. Some good kinds of evidence include:\n\nStudent evaluations of teaching (SET) ratings and selected comments.\nMaterials that you created as an instructor or teaching assistant.\nParticipation in professional development activities related to teaching.\n\nIt’s usually expected that at least one of your letters of recommendation will speak to your teaching potential. With this in mind, you should plan early: who will write your teaching letter, and what information will they have? It’s a good idea to ask your prospective writer well in advance. Their letter may be stronger if you can give them materials from previous courses, a draft of your teaching statement, or an opportunity to observe one of your classes.\n\n\nIn Your Cover Letter\nFirst and foremost, carefully read the job ad in order to avoid silly mistakes. If your cover letter highlights your interest in mentoring graduate students, and the institution doesn’t have graduate students, then the committee is unlikely to move forward on your application.\nMore generally, find ways to connect the job posting to your interests, and share them in your cover letter. My cover letter to Middlebury expressed:\n\nMy overall interest in the school and the department.\nMy excitement about the location, including the presence of many collaborators at nearby institutions.\nMy interest in collaborating on data science initiatives, which I knew from the job ad and the Middlebury website to be an area of institutional focus.\nMy teaching interests and how I felt these would align with the department’s mission.\n\nI am intending this advice specifically for jobs at SLACs; I claim no insight on what is best to do at larger schools.\n\n\nWhen Should I Diclose an Academic Partner?\nIf you and your partner are both academics and seeking jobs at the same institution, then you face the question of when to disclose this situation to the hiring committee and the administration. There are a lot of different points of view on this question, with two extremes:\n\nDisclose immediately, usually on your cover letter.\nDisclose only after you have received a written offer from the school.\n\nThere are also in-between possibilities, like disclosing after you have completed a first- or second-round interview.\nBecause SLACs are very small and new positions can be scarce, my personal recommendation is to disclose as early as you feel comfortable. In many cases, it is possible for schools to make arrangements for partner hires, but this usually takes time and multiple layers of administrative decision-making. Disclosing early helps make this possible.\nIt’s true that disclosing early may cause you not to get interviews that you might otherwise have gotten. That said, these are probably interviews that would not have led to a successful partner hire, so this may not be a loss.\n\nWill My Partner Also Be Hired Tenure-Track?\nIn my experience, you should expect that a partner-hire situation at a SLAC will not result in both partners being immediately hired into tenure-track roles. Tenure lines at SLACs are very difficult to create on short notice. You should expect the school to be invested in the long-term success of both you and your partner, but you may have to be flexible about the details of that journey."

My only tailoring was in my cover letter, where I addressed specific courses I could teach and how I would fit into individual departments.\n\nStatement on research.\nStatement on teaching.\nStatement on equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI).\n\nA complete application usually also includes a cover letter addressing specific reasons why the candidate is an excellent fit for the specific institution, and 3-4 letters of reference.

    "title": "Math Autobiography",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my math autobiography, which I wrote as an illustration for students writing their on math autobiographies in CSCI 0200: Math Foundations of Computing.\nMy first vivid memory with mathematics is a bad one. I was in 4th grade, and I was starting at a “C” on my report card. I was a Smart Kid. I was Good At Math. I Did Not Get Cs. What happened? Well, my teacher explained, I wasn’t writing down any of my steps. I was trying to work out answers in my head, to skip things and get to the end faster. So, predictably, I was getting stuff wrong.\nI learned to show my work, but I never loved my math classes. I was always pretty good at them, and usually “felt smart” while I was working on problems. But I didn’t really see much point, and struggled to feel interested in my classes. In case you’re wondering, I resolved in high school that I was going to grow up to be a philosopher.\nThis changed for me late in high school, when I noticed a pattern that interested me in certain sums of powers of integers.  The freedom to actually explore something for myself, to discover something interesting about mathematics, changed my entire outlook. I eventually put together a science fair project about the patterns I found. By the time I got to college, I was motivated to pursue and complete a math major. Along the way, I really benefited from the opportunity to explore the math, especially in how it was applied to modeling stuff in the real world. I think my best teachers in high school and college found ways to keep me excited about that journey, and allowed me to go a bit off of the path that they might have planned for me.I was looking into formulas for things like: \\(\\sum_{i = 1}^n i = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\). We learn how to prove formulas like these in classes like CSCI 0200.\nI spent some time working as a data analyst at a healthcare nonprofit. This was a pretty transformative experience for me in a lot of ways, and one of them was the interest it gave me in data and data science. When I decided it was time for me to go to grad school, I focused on programs that would allow me to explore the mathematics of data science. Once I got there, I really appreciated the control I had over which classes I took, what I spent my time thinking about, and what I got to learn. It was perfect for me! I learned the best when I could approach a new topic with motivation from my research. I want to do \\(X\\), so I’d better learn how to use \\(Y\\) to do it. It was great. This is a spirit that I still try to bring to my research, and in certain ways I also try to channel it in the classes I teach.\nFor me, what feels good about math is the feeling of achieving something correct, powerful, and interesting. I like the results! I think a lot of mathematicians will tell you that they love the process of working through problems, puzzling it out, etc. I’m not so much like that. In the process of working on problems, I can be stressed, grouchy, frustrated, or even a little bit angry at myself for not having gotten it yet. But when I eventually do get it – possibly after quite a while – I feel relieved, powerful, and motivated by what I’ve achieved. Maybe this isn’t the healthiest relationship to have to the practice of mathematics, but it’s the one I have. I overall love my life and identity as an applied mathematician, even if the going is tough sometimes.\nGoing back to that C on my report card in 4th grade, there was an important lesson for me in that experience, although it took me a while to fully understand it:\n\nWhat’s important in practicing mathematics isn’t “being a math person:” it’s being patient, doing the work, and learning from failure. Everyone can do this.\n\nI bring this lesson into my teaching: I’m committed to offering learning experiences in which everyone can grow, discover, and feel powerful through the practice of mathematics."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this short blog post, I’ll illustrate how to acquire and visualize US Census data choropleths using R. Since the last time I worked on spatial data, the R ecosystem surrounding Census data and geospatial visualization has evolved considerably. As a result, while I make an effort here to show the use of the latest packages, I’m limited a bit in my knowledge of what’s going on behind the scenes.\nOur aim in this blog post will be to construct a choropleth map showing the percentage of Black residents in each of the block groups in Providence, with selected locations highlighted on top. We are just going to do a minimal version of this task: there are lots of customization and appearance possibilities for the map that we won’t mess with.\nWe’ll use the following R packages:\n\nlibrary(tigris)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(acs)       # only used for lists of counties\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n\n\n\nNext we’ll acquire a shapefile of Census blockgroups in Providence:\n\ncounties &lt;- fips.county %&gt;% \n    filter(State == \"RI\") %&gt;% \n    filter(County.Name == \"Providence County\") %&gt;%\n    select(County.ANSI) %&gt;% \n    unlist()\n\nbg &lt;- tigris::block_groups(state = \"RI\", county = counties, cb=TRUE) %&gt;%\n  sf::st_transform('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84')\n\nNow we’ll acquire Census demographic data, in this case from the 2015-2020 American Community Survey (ACS). We’ll acquire the ACS’ basic breakdown of race and ethnicity. Census Reporter is a useful site for finding the table codes for various topics of interest. We are using the tidycensus package to obtain the data.\n\n# if you haven't done so before, you need to acquire and \n# log a Census API key prior to the get_acs call. \n# API keys can be obtained here: \n# http://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html\n# once you have your key, run \n# census_api_key(\"text-of-key\")\n\nvars &lt;- load_variables(2020, \"acs5\", cache = TRUE) %&gt;% \n    filter(grepl(\"B03002\", name),\n           str_sub(label, start=-1) != \":\") \n\nrace_ethnicity &lt;- get_acs(geography = \"block group\", \n                variables = vars$name, \n                year = 2020, \n                state = \"RI\")\n\nThe race_ethnicity data frame now contains the ACS estimates for each column (representing a racial group) and blockgroup (representing a geographic area).

It might not be obvious that information theory is a promising framework for thinking about diversity and segregation. The study of segregation isn’t usually viewed as an inference or communication engineering problem, and therefore doesn’t get much attention from information theorists and statisticians. On the other hand, sociological researchers in quantitative segregation studies do use information-theoretic measures, but tend to be less concerned about the mathematical subtleties. My goal in this blog post and the next is to develop information theory from the ground up as an organizing framework for thinking about diversity segregation. This framework both makes explicit the logic of some of our intuitive thinking about segregation, and also points the way to a wide vista of important extensions, generalizations, and applications."

On Saturday, each of the three tea preferences was equally represented, and folks spread themselves throughout the shop more-or-less randomly.

There will soon be other courses tagged as RC courses within and beyond the department of computer science. Our CS majors will be required to take at least one such course in order to complete the major.\nThe course attracted 42 students split across the two sections.

From the syllabus:\n\n\nNo revisions suggested: you’ve done great work and should focus on the next thing.\nRevisions useful: you have opportunities for improvement on this assignment, but focusing on the next topic or assignment may be a better use of your time—use your judgment.\nRevisions encouraged: the best use of your time is to respond to feedback and resubmit, rather than moving on to the next assignment.\nIncomplete: the assignment isn’t sufficiently complete for it to be used as evidence of your learning.\n\n\nIn practice, these were represented as point-scores 0-3 in Canvas. I also used these point “scores” to communicate with students about the progress of the class through the course; e.g. saying that “the median student has a ‘score’ of 10 points total.” In practice, I think that this was perhaps a step too close to points-based grading, and may have caused some students to focus on getting “3”s (no revisions suggested) or wondering how many “points” they needed in order to earn a certain grade. Both of these tendencies, while natural, are contrary to the environment I was trying to create, and I may try to do this differently next time.\nProjects were assessed in an individualized manner based on what was achieved in the project and the students’s contribution to their group’s work. The assessment was informal and used as evidence of learning and achievement in the context of setting the student’s final grade in the course."

High entropy, high diversity.\nNow let’s move on to an information-theoretic view of segregation. It’s important to remember that segregation is a fundamentally distinct concept from diversity. We can remind ourselves of this difference by recalling the example of the tea drinkers in the cafe. There are drinkers who prefer black, red, and green teas; on three different days, the population of the cafe looked like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTea drinkers in the cafe on three different days. Colors encode the kinds of tea they are drinking.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re interested in whether or not the shop is diverse, and whether or not it is segregated (by room). Intuitively,\n\nFriday is neither diverse nor segregated.\nSaturday is diverse, but relatively unsegregated.\nSunday is diverse but highly segregated.\n\nAs you may remember, the entropy \\(H\\) could distinguish Friday (\\(H = 0\\)) from Saturday and Sunday (\\(H = 1.10\\)), but couldn’t distinguish Saturday and Sunday from each other.

Let’s step back from the context of diversity for a moment to explore this point. To do this, let’s compare \\(I(X,Y)\\) to a more familiar quantity that does something similar: the correlation coefficient \\(R^2\\). If you took a statistics class, you might remember linear regression, the problem of drawing a “best fit” line through a cloud of data plotted on the \\(x-y\\) plane. One thing you might have done was to compute “\\(R^2\\),” which is more formally called the Pearson correlation coefficient. When \\(R^2 = 1\\), the explanatory variable \\(x\\) is perfectly correlated with the explanandum \\(y\\), but when \\(R^2 = 0\\), there’s no linear relationship. One thing that might have been emphasized to you is:\n\n\\(R^2 = 0\\) does not imply that the variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are independent.\n\nHere’s a set of examples that you can view on Wikipedia: the bottom row data sets are all uncorrelated (\\(R^2 = 0\\)), but clearly not independent.\nThe mutual information \\(I(X,Y)\\) is something like a supercharged correlation coefficient, in the sense that:\n\n\\(I(X,Y) = 0\\) does imply that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.\n\nOne nice thing about this result is that it actually makes precise an intuition about probabilistic dependence that many of us share: two variables are dependent if knowing one “gives you information” about the other. \\(I(X,Y)\\) quantifies this idea and makes it rigorously correct. Another way to say this is:\n\nThe tea shop is segregated when knowing which room someone is sitting in gives high information about their tea preferences, or vice versa."

This is an extremely practical propety of information measures when performing multiscale spatial analysis. Here’s a figure from my paper on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nCensus tracts in Detroit. Each tract is colored according to the racial group that is most overrepresented there when compared to the overall city-wide average. Black lines were found by an algorithm, and their thickness corresponds to their contribution to overall segregation. I have since learned that the use of a catchall category “Other” is harmful, and will work on doing better on this in the future. Figure reproduced from Chodrow, P. (2017). Structure and Information in Spatial Segregation. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n\n\n\nThis figure divides the city of Detroit, MI into six regions. If \\(X\\) is a census tract, we can think of \\(f:X\\mapsto X\\) as the function that assigns to each \\(X\\) the region in which that tract is located. Now, mathematically, a quick argument shows that we can write \\[\nI(X,Y) = I(Z,Y) + I(X,Y|Z)\\;,\n\\] where \\(I(X,Y|Z)\\) is the mean mutual information within each of the regions. We can again interpret these terms: \\(I(Z,Y)\\) is the amount of segregation accounted for by the division into regions, while \\(I(X,Y|Z)\\) is the amount of segregation “left over” because it lies within regions. Substituting back into Equation 1, we have\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH(Y) &= H(Y|X) + I(Z,Y) + I(X,Y|Z) \\\\\n\\text{Global Diversity} &= \\text{Local Exposure} + \\text{Segregation Between Regions} + \\text{Segregation Within Regions}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis style of analysis is extremely helpful for studying segregation at multiple scales."

    "text": "Introduction\nHi everyone.\nThanks for joining me today. My name is Phil Chodrow. I’m a professor of computer science here at Midd. Some of you may know me from classes in introductory computing, math foundations, or machine learning. If you’re in the room and we’ve met, it’s great to see you again. If not, I hope we’ll get the chance to meet in the future.\nIn college, I had a love of abstract mathematics. I loved all the symbols and how they fit together; the way that when you solve a math problem you really know that you’ve gotten it. When I was doing math, I really felt like I had managed to touch something true, and that felt great. When I left college, I…flailed around a bit…and wound up as a data analyst at a healthcare nonprofit. This was a pretty transformative experience for me in a lot of ways. One of those ways was a new interest: I was excited about using data and data science in order to make the world around me a little better. This interest caught fire in me and eventually pushed me to grad school, where I kept working on problems at the intersection of math, data science, and our social world. These days, my research still includes a lot of fun math, but now it also includes data science for sustainability, equity, and justice.\nIn the last couple years, I’ve developed new ways for measuring segregation and inequality; written an analysis of law enforcement data that was submitted to the Supreme Court; studied racial disparities in criminal sentencing in Virginia; and written an article on how folks in my scholarly community can contribute to justice causes. I’ve brought all this work here with me to Middlebury.\nThis work—data science for social justice—doesn’t belong to me, and I didn’t invent it. There’s a long tradition of folks using data science to resist oppression and build a better world. I want to spend most of the rest of our time together sharing a bit about this tradition and about the role of data science in our present day. Then, since I’m a professor here, I’m going to finish up by leaving you with a little homework."

    "section": "The Light of Truth",
    "text": "The Light of Truth\nThe theme of this event is “Truth and Dare.” Not “or”—“and.” When I first heard this phrase, I immediately thought back to a famous line from the civil rights activist and reformer Ida B. Wells:\n\n\nThe way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon them.\n\nNow, you can see our theme running all through this statement. If we dare to right the wrongs of the world, then we do so with the light of truth. We need to tell the world what is happening. For Wells, this looked like telling the world about escalating violence against African Americans—including lynching—in the America of the 1880s and 1890s. The truth in Wells’s work of this time is a combination of in-depth, investigative reporting and carefully compiled statistics describing the brutal extent of lynching and its impact on Black Americans. The dare of this was work was literally putting her safety on the line. After her anti-lynching advocacy began to make waves in both the American South and the North, Wells’s newspaper in Memphis was violently attacked. She herself continued her work in Harlem, New York and in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nThere’s a rich history of African American civil rights advocates turning the light of truth on the wrongs of the world with statistics and data science. Here’s another famous example. Leading up to the 1900 World’s Fair, Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois and a team of students at Atlanta University created a series of vivid data visualizations describing the conditions of life for African Americans in Georgia and the greater United States. Du Bois described his vision for this exhibit:\n\n…An honest and straightforward exhibit of a small nation of people, picturing their life and development without apology or gloss, and above all made by themselves.\n\n\nThese visualizations are all hand-drawn representations of the reality for African Americans. Not all of them have an explicit agenda. Some of them are just maps of how much land was owned by African Americans in the state of Georgia, or simple visualizations of who worked in what professions.\n\n\nOthers are much starker descriptions of the impact of violence and systemic oppression. For example, here is a description of the ages of African Americans in Georgia as compared to Black residents of France. Each bar represents the proportion in an age group – for example, the top black bar says that 30.1% of African Americans in Georgia were under 10 years old, compared to 17.5% of Black residents of France in the yellow bar. If you see the black bar shrinking down much faster than the yellow bar as we move down the page, that is telling you a grizzly story – African Americans in Georgia were much less likely to grow to old age when compared to Black residents of France, due to violence, systemic discrimination, and disparity. We can see echoes of this plot in the US to this day, where Black Americans still have lower life expectancies due to systemic disparities in healthcare, educational access, and economic opportunity.\nNow, they didn’t have this phrase 100 years ago, but these days we can recognize what Ida B. Wells and Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois were doing data science. Both of them were collecting rich, complicated data; analyzing it through the lenses of expertise and lived experience; and communicating their findings in careful, honest, and effective ways. They use data – representations of collective facts – to turn the light of truth on systemic injustice. Their data science was a practice of resistance."

    "section": "Our Present",
    "text": "Our Present\nSo now let’s turn to the present. These days, we’re seeing data and data science on unprecedented scales. If you have a laptop that holds 256 gigabytes of storage, like mine does, then you would need one billion (with a B) of those just to hold the data that we produce in a single day. Increasingly, corporations are thinking about how to make profit from all this data, and they are hiring people to do it. Job demand for data scientists exploded over the last decade, and is expected to continue to grow.\nIf you look at your day-to-day life, you are surrounded by data science. When you get a recommended post, or a targeted ad, or even just a spelling suggestion when you text, you are experiencing the work of millions of hours of data science at some of the world’s largest corporations. But here’s the thing. It’s not just the little stuff day-to-day. Data science is going to play a role in some of the biggest decisions of your life.\n\nAre you applying for a job? Your resume, or even your face, might get scanned and screened by machine learning systems.\nAre you trying to rent an apartment? You might be screened by a predictive algorithm that estimates your “willingness to pay” rent each month.\nAre you sick? Summaries of your visits to the doctor, recommendations for your care plan, and recommendations for what your insurance should cover may be informed by generative language models.\nDo you live in the jurisdiction of a police department that uses predictive analytics? You might be recommended for a watch-list based on aspects of your identity and residence, regardless of your prior history with the law enforcement system.\n\nSo, data science technologies don’t just feed us content and ads – they are also with us for some of the biggest decisions about where we will work, where we will live, what care we will receive, and whether we will be free. And, as you might have seen or even studied, so many of these tools reinforce sexism, racism, and economic inequality. Now, this is not a new thing – data as a tool of oppression and control has a long, dark history. I just want to remind you that this history is not just history – it’s also our present.\nNow, this might feel a little different from the data science of Ida B. Wells and Dr. Du Bois, right? When we look to them, we see data science as an act of resistance against oppression and control. This liberatory kind of data science – data science as resistance, data science for social justice – is also in our present. To my mind, this work has taken two different directions into our present day. I want to highlight a little about each of those two directions before I finish off with a challenge.\n\nCritical Perspectives on Data Science Technologies\nThe first direction I want to highlight for you is critical perspective on data science technologies. When we take a critical perspective, we ask ourselves questions like:\n\nWhat are the actual, measurable impacts of data science technologies on human beings?\nWho benefits from the spread of data science technologies? Who is harmed?\nHow do benefits and harms of data science technologies align with historical and present racism, misogyny, classism, and other systems of oppression?\n\n\nCritical perspective most frequently comes from people who have identities or experiences that help them understand marginalization and oppression. With this in mind, I’d like to briefly point towards the work of many expert women of color who are bringing critical perspective on the role of data in our world today.\nDr. Safiya Umoja Noble is the author of the book Algorithms of Oppression, a deep dive into how search–the precursor of contemporary generative machine learning–can reinforce deeply harmful stereotypes related to race and gender. Dr. Joy Buolamwini is a computer scientist who played a leading role in uncovering intersectional gender and racial bias in widely-used computer vision systems. She collaborated in this work with Dr. Timnit Gebru, who has also written on the limitations of large language models and the ideological currents expressed by certain influential leaders in artificial general intelligence.\n\n\nData Activism Today\nThe partner of critical perspective is data activism – using data to make a difference. I started us off with early data activism in the work of Ida B. Wells and Dr. W. E. B. Du Bois. This work continues in our present. One national-scale example of modern data resistance comes from the Mapping Police Violence project. The team behind this project collects data on every instance they can find in which law enforcement takes a life. In addition to publishing this data in raw form for anyone to use, they also publish the dashboard that I’ve highlighted here. An important feature of this project is the attention they pay to data quality: they use a multi-step process in order to gather reliable data. Then, they present it with a focus on the facts. Yes, there is an activist agenda here as well, but it’s separate – the purpose of this project is to produce the high-quality data projects that support activism and advocacy.\nAnother example, closer to home, comes from folks working to combat homelessness here in Vermont. As you may know, our state have the second-highest rate of homelessness in the US, behind only California. In a 2023 report, the Vermont Coalition to End Homelessness and the Chittenden County Homelessness Alliance presented a pretty damning picture for our state: the number of individuals experiencing homelessness on a single night in our state has doubled compared to similar counts five years ago. This count appears to still be on the rise, due in part to rising rents and the end of pandemic era housing supports. This is challenging data science work, from data collection to interpretation to presentation to advocacy. These organizations are daring to turn the light of truth on a deep social wrong."

    "text": "My challenges for you\nSo to you all, especially the students in the room: obviously, since I’m a professor, I have homework for you. My homework comes in the form of challenges. Dares, if you will.\n\nIf you are already powerful in data science…\nFirst, some of you in here might already be powerful in data science. Maybe you’ve taken some classes in mathematics, statistics, or computer science. Maybe you’ve declared a major, or done a data science project in one of your classes. My dare for you is to ask yourself:\n\nHow can I use my skills in data science contribute to a more just, equitable, peaceful, and sustainable world?\n\nIt can actually be pretty difficult to know what data science work is going to make the world more just, equitable, peaceful, and sustainable. That’s the lesson we have to learn from all the stories about bias in modern data systems. No one plans to make a racist machine learning model. It happens through systematic negligence, unaware privilege, and failure to learn about the experiences and identities of people different from you.\nSo, to use your powers for good, approach your work with humility about the many, many things that you do not know and have not experienced. Stay humble, stay curious, and listen. Listen to the people your data is about. Listen to the folks who might be impacted, for good or for ill, by your work. Listen to activists. Listen to expert women of color. Listen, challenge your assumptions, and learn.\n\n\nIf you are an activist…\nNow I also want to address my activists and resisters in the room. Y’all are on the front lines fighting for a world with less oppression, discrimination, inequity, and violence. First of all – thank for your courage and for fighting your fight.\nYour insight, from your experience and the experience of the communities you fight for, is needed as we seek a more inclusive and equitable world of data science. Rightly or wrongly, to get yourself in the conversations that matter most, it’s necessary to speak the language – data, computation, statistics, figures.\nSo, my challenge for you is simple: level yourselves up with data. Seek allies who are gathering the data that your movement needs – or become the person who’s gathering data that your movement needs. Learn to work with your data, understand its power and its limitations. Here at Midd we have a lot of ways for you to do that, and we’re getting more every year. Level yourselves up, get in the room, and be heard.\n\n\nWrapping up\nY’all. Data science is a part of our present day, and it’s complicated. Data science a fun and exciting way to apply skills to the real world. Data science is an oppressive and inequitable tool of racialized corporate power. It’s both/and. Today, I’ve encouraged you to look to some folks in our history and our present day to see the promise of data science as a practice of resistance. I try to take some inspiration from their work, and I hope that you will too.\nSo. You see wrong in the world? Turn the light of truth.\nThanks y’all."

    "section": "Information As Approximation",
    "text": "Information As Approximation\nLet \\(\\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{Y}\\) be two finite sets. Let \\(p_{XY}\\) be a probability distribution on \\(\\mathcal{X}\\times \\mathcal{Y}\\). That is, if I pick a random object from \\(\\mathcal{X}\\times \\mathcal{Y}\\), the probability that this object has property \\(x \\in \\mathcal{X}\\) and \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\) is \\(p_{XY}(x,y)\\). Concretely, think of \\(X\\) as being a demographic feature like wealth and \\(Y\\) as being a spatial location. Then, \\(p_{XY}(\\text{high wealth}, \\mathrm{Providence})\\) is the fraction of all people who have high wealth and live in Providence. We’ll develop an information measure to quantify the extent to which \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are dependent or correlated. I’ll treat the extent of dependence or correlation as an operating definition of “demographic spatial segregation.”\nWe develop the idea of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) as being dependent by considering the conditional distributions \\(p_{X|y}(x) = \\frac{p_{XY}(x,y)}{p_Y(y)}\\).  Here, \\(p_Y(y) = \\sum_{x\\in \\mathcal{X}} p_{XY}(x,y)\\) is the marginal distribution of \\(Y\\). You can think of \\(p_{X|y}(x)\\) as the probability that an individual in location \\(y\\) has demographic attribute \\(x\\). The distribution \\(p_{X|y}\\) is an element of \\(\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathcal{X}}\\), the set of probability distributions over \\(\\mathcal{X}\\). We have one of those distributions for each possible choice of \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\). If these distributions are very different – if they depend strongly on the choice of \\(y\\) – then knowing \\(y\\) would make a big difference in what we know about \\(x\\). We would say that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are highly dependent. How do we measure how different the collection of distributions \\(\\{p_{X|y}\\}\\) is? A standard, two-step approach is:The notation \\(p_{X|y}(x)\\) is nonstandard, and is chosen to make some later calculations a bit more compact.\n\nFirst, find a point \\(\\bar{p}_X\\) that best approximates all the marginal distributions \\(p_{X|y}\\).\nCompute the average divergence of the conditionals to \\(\\bar{p}_X\\). This average is \\[\nI_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) d_f(p_{X|y}, \\bar{p}_X)\n\\] This is a gnarly expression, but you can think of as expressing: on average, how far (in the sense of divergence \\(d_f\\)) is a typical local distribution \\(p_{X|y}\\) from its approximator \\(\\bar{p}_X\\)? If the answer is small, then we know that all the local distributions aren’t too far from their approximators, and therefore shouldn’t be too far from each other, either.\n\nAs it turns out, there’s a correct choice of \\(\\bar{p}_X\\). This result is Proposition 1 of Banerjee et al. (2005).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 2 (Mean is a Minimizer) For any Bregman divergence, the smallest value of \\(I_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X)\\) is attained when \\(\\bar{p}_X = p_X\\), the marginal distribution of \\(X\\). This distribution is given by \\(p_X(x) = \\sum_{y \\in Y}p_{XY}(x,y)\\). More formally,\n\\[\n\\mathop{\\mathrm{argmin\\;}}_{\\bar{p}_X} I_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X) = p_X\\;.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBregman Information\n\n\n\nWe will use the abbreviation \\(I_f(X: Y) = I_f(X:Y;p_X)\\) for the minimizing value of \\(I_f(X:Y;\\bar{p}_X)\\). We call \\(I_f(X:Y)\\) the Bregman information in \\(Y\\) about \\(X\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 3 (Bregman Information and Independence) Let \\(f\\) be strictly convex and let \\(p_Y(y) &gt; 0\\) for all \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\). Then, \\(I_f(X:Y) = 0\\) if and only if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent random variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nProof. Recall that \\(I_f(X:Y) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) d_f(p_{X|y}, p_X)\\). Since \\(p_Y(y) &gt; 0\\) for each \\(y \\in \\mathcal{Y}\\) by hypothesis, for \\(I_f(X:Y) = 0\\) we must have \\(d_f(p_{X|y}, p_X)\\) for each \\(y\\). If \\(f\\) is strictly convex, then by Theorem 1, \\(d_f(p,q) = 0\\) iff \\(p = q\\). So, we must have \\(p_{X|y} = p_X\\) for each \\(y\\), which implies that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent.\n\nThere is another formula for the Bregman information that helps to interpret its meaning. This formula is the version emphasized in this post, which expresses global diversity as a sum of local diversity and global segregation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTheorem 4 The Bregman information satisfies\n\\[\nI_f(X:Y) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) f(p_{X|y}) - f(p_X)\\;.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nProof. We can directly write out \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n    I_f(X:Y) &= \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) d_f(p_{X|y}, p_X) \\\\\n             &= \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) \\left[f(p_{X|y}) - f(p_X) - \\langle \\nabla f(p_X), p_{X|y} - p_X\\rangle \\right] \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] Next, we use that \\(\\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) p_X = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) p_{X|y} = p_X\\), which causes the inner product to vanish. The only remaining terms are \\[\nI_f(X:Y) = \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} p_Y(y) f(p_{X|y}) - f(p_X)\\;,\n\\] completing the proof.\n\nTheorem 4 is often used as the definition of the mutual information in the context of Shannon information theory; indeed, it’s the definition that I emphasize in my previous post on Shannon information theory. The interpretation of this theorem as relating global segregation, global diversity, and local diversity translates directly."

    "section": "My Profession",
    "text": "My Profession\n\nWhat are you? Are you a computer scientist, a mathematician, or a data scientist?\nUh…yes? I am all those things!\nMy training was primarily mathematical. These days I use math, algorithms, simulations, and data analysis to learn about complex systems in theory, society, and nature. Almost all my work involves software implementation, and I’m working on growing my skills as a developer in order to help more people use and reproduce my findings.\n\n\nWhat kinds of things do you like to study?\nNetworks and complex social systems! You can learn lots more about my interests on my research page.\n\n\nWhat do you do all day?\nThis graphic by Marissa Kawehi Loving gives a high-level overview of the activities that go into a career as an academic mathematician. My activities as a computer scientist / mathematician / data scientist look relatively similar. Mentally, I’d divide them into the following broad categories:\n\n“Doing science”: developing models and algorithms, proving mathematical facts about them, performing computations, analyzing data, and reading papers.\nWriting: creating notes, writing scholarly papers, writing reviews of the scholarly work of others.\nCommunication: largely emails and meetings. Lots of the “doing science” part happens in these meetings (i.e. collaboratively). An important category here is mentorship: working with junior collaborators and students; talking about ideas; giving feedback. Another important category here is speaking about my research, which used to happen at conferences but is now largely online.\nTeaching: I spend a lot of time on teaching. The preparation includes formulating course philosophies, designing curricula, writing lectures and assignments, etc. Then there’s the best part – working with students – as well as managing instructional teams, handling grades, and troubleshooting concerns as they arise.\n\nProfessional development: there’s a lot of room for me to grow. One of my main goals is to further develop my courses as actively anti-sexist and anti-racist, and measure their effectiveness along these axes. I attend trainings, read, and learn from others.\n\n\n\nIs it nice to be a professor? Should I become one?\nHere’s my personal list of the pros and cons about being a professor. This list is quite personal to me, and reflects my identity and priorities. Note that the pros and cons for computer scientists and mathematicians working in industry look very different.\nPros:\n\nFreedom to control my own schedule.\nFreedom to set my priorities and spend much of my time thinking about things that interest me.\nFreedom to decide whom to work with (very important to me).\n\nCons:\n\nLow salary compared to many other careers for quantitative people (although still enough for me to have a comfortable life).\nUncertainty about long-term job prospects. I didn’t know where I would spend most of my career—or whether I would even make it in my chosen career—until I was 31.\nLack of control over location: I’m very happy here, and I’m exceptionally lucky to have been able to choose to come here over several other attractive options. In general, though, academics often won’t be able to choose where they will live. This is one factor that can contribute to challenges associated with being an academic and starting a family.\n\n\n\nIs academic science an equitable space, a “meritocracy,” or a “neutral” discipline?\nNo. Academic science is not yet an equitable community, and many parts of it replicate systemic misogyny, racism, ableism, and classism. Certain people, departments, and institutions are not safe or nurturing spaces for members of certain groups. For example, a recent article in Scientific American highlighted the intersection of racism and misogyny in modern mathematics.\nDue in part to my own privileged identity, I have had an overall pleasant experience in academic science which makes me want to stay here. If you do aspire to become an academic computer scientist, mathematician, data scientist, or scholar of any kind—and especially if you benefit from intersecting privilege—then part of your responsibility is to reflect on what work you will do to make our profession a more equitable and just place. The Mission page expresses how I think about this responsibility, and the Resources page contains some links that might help you get started."

    "section": "Thoughts on Software",
    "text": "Thoughts on Software\n\nWhat software do you use?\nI spend a lot of time on my laptop, and I’ve given some thought to the tools that allow me to be most productive in that time. Here’s what I’m using these days:\n\nProgramming languages: Julia and R. I also know (and teach) Python, but Julia has largely replaced Python in my research workflows. I use R when I am primarily working with data frames or when I need to construct scientific graphics, and I use Julia for most other tasks. I still cheerfully work in Python when collaborating with folks who strongly prefer it.\nWriting: LaTeX and Markdown. I use LaTeX for most technical writing, including scientific articles, reviews of other’s writings, working notes containing proofs and similar things, and any time I want to produce a PDF document. Lots of folks don’t like LaTeX, but perhaps through raw familiarity I am a very cheerful LaTeX writer. I use Markdown for most other writing, especially including writing for websites like this one.\nText editor: VSCode. I use this for writing code, as well as writing mathematical documents and research papers using LaTeX. I have extensions that make it easy to work with some of my main tools, including Python, Julia, R, LaTeX, Quarto, and Markdown. When coding in R, I sometimes use RStudio instead of VSCode.\nOperating system: MacOS. I don’t have strong negative feelings about Windows, but as someone who writes code I strongly prefer an OS with a first class terminal. I have dabbled in Linux but don’t consider myself enough of a power user to justify the time investment. Because I have access to high-performance servers, I don’t need a very powerful laptop.\nWebsite: Quarto and GitHub. This website, as well as my course websites, are generated by the Quarto publishing sytem using plaintext files. I edit these files in VSCode, run Quarto to preview them, and then push them to GitHub which hosts them online. Through working on my websites, I have picked up a minimal amount of HTML and CSS.\n\nEthics note: GitHub has contributed an infrastructure product to ICE and developed a machine learning product that may infringe on open source code licenses. While I rely on GitHub for now, I may change to a competitor like GitLab or BitBucket in the future.\n\nEmail client: Spark – it’s free, simple, and cross-platform.\nLauncher: Alfred. Pressing a simple keyboard shortcut spawns a search bar when I can open apps, search for files, etc.\nBrowser: Arc. A customizable browser compatible with Chrome plugins.\n\n\n\nIs programming language A better than programming language B?\nProbably not! Most programming languages have certain strengths in which they excel. You don’t need “the best” programming language – you need the one that’s right for your task. For example, R and Python have different strengths for data science, and most practicing data scientists know both. Here are my thoughts on the languages I know and use.\n\nPython: extremely versatile, pretty good at almost everything. Often slower than compiled languages like C++ or just-in-time compiled languages like Julia. Widely used in industry, and an excellent first language to learn. Extremely vibrant ecosystem of free software modules.\nR: specialized for data analysis and statistics. World-class handling of tabular data via the Tidyverse ecosystem. ggplot2 is the world’s best two-dimensional data visualization system, bar none. The RStudio IDE is excellent.\n\nJulia: specialized for technical computing (science and engineering applications). Similar syntax to Python. Often compared to Matlab in its focus, but open-source and (in my view) easier to understand. Well-written Julia is extremely fast, and can reach speeds comparable to C++."

Toward this vision, I offer the following acknowledgments and commitments.\n\n\nSeveral of my identities are over-represented and normalized in the academy.\nI am a White, heterosexual, cisgender man, and a 2nd generation academic. I promote a more diverse scientific community by amplifying the voices of minoritized scholars, decentering myself in conversations that aren’t about me, and examining how my intersecting privileges can be tools for equitable progress rather than self-advancement at the expense of others. I am aware that my work as an aspiring ally is never done, and that I will need to perpetually reexamine my own positionality and my understanding of my other commitments towards justice.\n\n\nMany students face unjust adversity in their STEM learning journey.\nMany female, LGBTQ+, BIPOC and disabled students encounter discouragement, trauma, and institutional barriers on account of their identities. These forms of adversity manifest systemic misogyny, homophobia, racism, and ableism.\nI envision a world in which all identities experience encouragement, safety, and grace in their pursuit of STEM education. I design inclusive classrooms with vibrant learning communities, clear expectations, and intentional assessment strategies. I conduct regular evaluations and listen to my students in order to understand how to make my teaching more responsive to the needs of all the learners who enter my classroom.\n\n\nNot all “scientific progress” serves humanity.\nMany scientists create tools for surveillance, control, advertising, physical violence, financial manipulation, and misinformation spread.\nWhile the choices of individuals to pursue such work is understandable in our current system of incentives, the net result is that much of our collective technical expertise actively works against our collective well-being. I work towards an ethical practice of computational science by actively incorporating ethics into my classrooms. These include case studies in algorithmic harm, as well as extended projects which model the role of computation and data science in addressing climate change, cultural representation, and systemic bias."

I will only refuse if you are requesting support for an application for jobs or internships involving surveillance, policing, or military applications. If I feel that I am not able to write you a strong letter, I will tell you – but if you still want a letter from me, I will still write it.\nPlease keep in mind that I can write stronger letters for students whom I see more frequently, such as in lecture or office hours. If you’d like a letter, talking to me in these contexts, or scheduling another meeting time, is highly recommended.\nTo request a letter, fill out this request form! Please give me at least one month of advance notice when possible.\n\n\nWill you write me a letter of recommendation for jobs and internships related to surveillance, policing, or military applications?\nAs a matter of moral principle, I will not write letters of recommendation for programs or jobs involving any of the following:\n\nPolicing (including but not limited to predictive policing, development of algorithms that predict recidivism, etc.);\nMilitary applications (such as internships at the Department of Defense or any of its international counterparts);\nWeapons manufacturing, broadly construed;\nIntelligence gathering (such as internships at the NSA, FBI, or any international counterpart).\n\nI am very happy to discuss this policy with any student who has questions. Conversations about when and how mathematics, data science, and programming should be used are lacking in our community. If you’d like to engage me in such a conversation, that would be great! However, this policy is non-negotiable. Therefore, if I refuse to write you a letter on these grounds, please know that it doesn’t reflect on your ability to succeed in this course, your career potential, your worth as a person, or whether I like you.\nThe Just Mathematics Collective has compiled a list of resources for students on making ethical career decisions, which is available here.

The department is not able to guarantee that the course will be offered every year, but this has been the recent trend.\nIn some years, only one section of CSCI 0451 is offered. In such years, there are typically only enough spots for seniors. In other years, two sections of CSCI 0451 are taught. In these years, there are usually enough spots for everyone who wants to enroll.\n\n\nDo I have to be a CSCI major or minor to take this class?\nIf you have considerable mathematics background (up to the level of MATH 0223: Multivariable Calculus) and if you have taken several courses involving data analysis and programming, you may be able to be successful in this course even if you are not a CSCI major. You can contact me about the possibility of a waiver to allow you to take the course. I treat such requests on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\nDo I need to have experience in Python programming to take this class?\nComfort programming in Python is strongly recommended in order to succeed in this class. In some cases I’ll waive in a student who has extensive? experience programming in another language (e.g. R or Matlab) and who demonstrates ability to self-teach Python at a rapid pace.\n\n\nDo I really need to take MATH 0200: Linear Algebra before I take this class?\nYes.\n\n\nDoes this course overlap with CSCI 0311: Artificial Intelligence or CSCI 0457: Natural Language Processing?\nThere is some overlap, although I have tried to minimize this to the extent reasonably possible.\n\n\nWill this course teach me the latest, cutting-edge tools in machine learning and generative AI?\nNo, the focus of this course is on theoretical fundamentals and their implementation in efficient code. The aim is to give you a foundation from which to explore more complex techniques ify ou choose."

Your social network; ecological food webs; the financial system; and the physical infrastructure of the internet are all examples of real-world networked systems.\nIn this class, we’ll use math and computation to study the structure and dynamics of networked systems. Some of the questions we’ll ask include:\n\nHow should we measure the structure of networked systems?\nHow do the networked systems we see in the world around us evolve to be the way they are? How can we model this with mathematics?\nHow can we use algorithms to extract insights from large network data?\nHow does the structure of a network constrain or enable interactions on that network, like information exchange or disease spread?\n\n\n\nWill this class help me get a job in software development?\nNo. \n\n\nWill I like this class?\nYou might like this class if several (but not necessarily all) of the following items describe you:\n\nYou like mathematics and statistics enough to enjoy doing calculations by hand and writing mathematical proofs.\n\nAlthough the only official mathematical prerequisite is linear algebra, students who have taken a course in probability (e.g. MATH/STAT 0310) or theoretical computer science (CSCI 0301 and 0302) are likely to find this course more engaging.\n\nYou like thinking about how mathematical or computational models relate to our complex social and technological worlds.\nYou have experience in physics, especially statistical physics.\nYou have several semesters of experience coding.\nYou have experience analyzing data in R or Python.\n\n\n\nWhat programming experience is required for this class?\nWe’ll use Python for all our computational experiments and data analysis in this class. Prior experience coding with Python is strongly recommended. If you do not have experience with Python and also do not have coursework beyond the 200-level in either math or theoretical CS (e.g. CSCI 0301 and 0302), you are likely in for a bad time.\n\n\nDoes this course count towards the mathematics or statistics majors?\nMajors in mathematics and statistics are warmly welcome to enroll in this course. However, the course does not towards these majors. It does count as college credit, a DED requirement, and an elective torwards the computer science major.\n\n\nHow often is this course offered?\nRoughly once every two years.\n\n\nIf I take this course, can I do research with Phil over the summer or as a thesis?\nDoing well in CSCI 0442 does not guarantee that I will accept you as a summer research student or thesis student. It definitely helps though!\n\n\nWill there be exams?\nThere will be one midterm exam and a final project, as well as regular problem sets. Problem sets will include both math problems and computational experiments."

Machine learning is not my research area and applied projects in machine learning usually don’t have enough scholarly depth to be appropriate for senior theses. If you have a specific idea related to machine learning that goes over and above “I am going to analyze a data set,” then I’m happy to consider your pitch.\n\n\nWhat courses should I take in order to be ready to do research with you?\nIn general, the minimal requirements for working with me on research topics are:\n\nMATH 0200 (Linear Algebra)\nAt least one advanced elective in CS that significantly uses mathematical content, especially those which have MATH 0200 as a prerequisite.\nComfort reading and writing mathematical descriptions of models and programs.\n\nThe following items are very helpful and increase the likelihood that I will accept you as a research student:\n\nAdditional advanced coursework in mathematics and statistics, especially including MATH/STAT 310 (Probability).\nAny elective course taken with me, especially CSCI 0442 (Network Science).\n\n\n\nAm I guaranteed to be able to do a thesis with you if I have a lot of relevant coursework?\nNo. I reserve the right to limit the number of students I advise on theses."

I feel like I’ve grown in my abilities to describe my ideas, communicate my coding thought process, work as a member of a group, time manage, not procrastinate, and approach problems with confidence instead of doubt. Thank you Professor Chodrow, and to all the TAs and LAs who have put so much time and love into this course! I’ve learned so much and I’m so excited to use it!!!  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nMy confidence has skyrocketed since taking this class. Coming from a low income community I felt extremely behind in the STEM field when I entered UCLA, and thought that any career with coding would just be a pipedream. Once I finished…my project it made me realize that I could actually do these things, and if I work hard and continue with my coding I could do it for a living.  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nI can’t believe I learned so much in the span of 10 weeks!! When I was interviewing for internships I could quote some of the class assignments and people were impressed :)  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nThank you for igniting the fire in me to pursue programming. Honestly, I entered this class scared because of the lack of coding experience. But in these three months, I ended up loving programming…I feel blessed that I got the opportunity to be in your class  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\n…going into this class, I was extremely worried and asking myself why I’m even trying. Thankfully, basically thanks to your doing, I’m leaving this course with a sense of pride about how much I’ve achieved and learned despite the voice in the back of my mind telling me I can’t do it…I’m proud of the progress I’ve made…  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\nI learned so much from this quarter. I feel the blogs were very helpful for me to understand the lectures and Dr. Chodrow always answers questions in a very clear way. He also makes the class super welcoming. The project is difficult but I’m really surprised that we were able to accomplish what we have. It’s a unique experience.  - PIC16B, Spring ’21\nThis class was fast-paced, but not unmangeable–it did challenge me, but in a good way.  - PIC16B, Fall ’21"

[In other courses] I consistently succeeded grade wise, but was left feeling depleted and mostly uninspired, I think in part due to feeling almost ignored as a student. Now, I have refueled hope and excitement to learn and explore topics from this course in the future.  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nHe is so understanding and the first professor to actually get to know my name, and he did this within the span of a few weeks. He is funny, understanding, nice and genuinely resonates with his students….I would have to say he is the best professor I’ve ever had.  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\nI just want to say that both the TA and professor did an amazing job with approaching the students and making them feel comfortable in our learning environment. It made a difficult and complex class a lot less stressful.  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nHis instruction and the way he has set up the class clearly demonstrates his dedication to teaching. He genuinely cares about his students and is not only very approachable but also he has given me encouragement and inspired me in my learning…To me, he represents the gold standard of what a professor should strive to be.  - PIC16B, Fall ’21"

But I have to say the discussions were some of my favorite parts of the week…I couldn’t have asked for a better group. I am so grateful for these friendships I have made.  - PIC16A, Winter ’21\nThe best thing about PIC 16A with regards to the class is my group! Discussion sections are one of the highlights of my week! We also have scheduled a time every week where we work together on the homework. It’s so refreshing to have contact with new people in these crazy circumstances.  - PIC16A, Fall ’20\nI think I’ve grown to see how valuable collaborative work is. Everyone has a unique way of working through logical problems and when these different thought processes come together, it’s like they merge into one new mega thought process &gt;:)  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nDiscussion activities were challenging but great; my group members and I, who aren’t very vocal, often physically cheered when something ran successfully.  - PIC16A, Spring ’21\nI have definitely improved in my ability to work collaboratively during the duration of this quarter. In discussion, I learned to speak up and provide my opinions on certain problems we were doing even when I thought I was the least qualified person in my group to provide an input. I also learned how to truly listen to their inputs on how and why to solve a certain problem.  - PIC16A, Fall ’21\nI think creating blog posts to do the homework assignments was wonderful! I’ve learned so much in this course not only through Professor Chodrow but also through my peers. Professor Chodrow facilitated a collaborative environment through peer feedbacks, which I loved.  - PIC16B, Spring ’21\nThe group project was a great way for me to make new friends and work with other students.  - PIC16B, Fall ’21"
