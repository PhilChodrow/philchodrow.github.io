I'm Phil Chodrow, assistant professor of computer science here at Middlebury. My pronouns are *he/him/his*. I love data science, math, *Star Trek: Deep Space Nine*, cooking, tea, Studio Ghibli movies, traditional martial arts, and effective pedagogy. A few miscellaneous facts about me: 

- I love aikido, a Japanese martial art focused on controlling conflict through locating personal strength and blending with the opponent.  I have served as a junior aikido instructor at Harvard Aikikai, New England Aikikai, and Aikido Tekkojuku of Boston. 
- I am a founder of NinjaGram at Swarthmore College. NinjaGram is a comic Valentine's Day card delivery service / charity that persists at Swarthmore to this day.
- I ran into [Magnus Carlsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen), the strongest active chess player, on a boat near Stavanger, Norway. I have his autograph!   
- While I lived in Norway, I did just a bit of skiing (cross-country and downhill). I'm eager to get back into skiing now that I again live in a beautiful snowy place! 


### Professional Journey

Before coming to Middlebury, I was a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA, mentored by [Mason Porter](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mason/). 
I did my PhD at MIT's [Operations Research Center](https://www.mit.edu/~orc/) under the mentorship of [Marta Gonz√°lez](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/marta-gonzalez) and [Patrick Jaillet](http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/). My research at MIT was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. Prior to MIT, I was an undergraduate at Swarthmore College and a Fulbright Research Scholar at the University of Oslo, Norway. Here's a visual representation of my journey (excluding Norway, which doesn't fit well on the map):
